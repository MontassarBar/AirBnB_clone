## About this project:
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## Usage:
Please clone the repository by copying this :
**https://github.com/MontassarBar/AirBnB_clone.git**

## Console:
A command interpreter is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
 - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
 - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
 - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
 - Update attributes of an object
 - Destroy an object

## Execute:
**./console.py**

## Examples:
